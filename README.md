HEY THERE,
THIS IS A SIMPLE SCRIPT TO SEND GMAIL THROUGH PYTHON APPLICATION 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS:
1-Clone or download to your local machine
2-Modify the conf.py file and set your email and password there 
3-Modify the sendEmail.py in the lines 15,16 and set your message there and the reciever email

Of Course you can do a list of emails so that you send email to multiply emails at once

It's the first time to make a README.md file so if you have any notice please send email to tony.dx.3379@gmail.com

Thanks.
